# SHORTEST PATH ALGORITHMS IMPLEMENT

This guide will help you run a local Python script on your machine. Follow the steps below to ensure you have everything set up correctly.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python Installation**
   - Ensure that Python is installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - After installation, verify the installation by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```
     or for some installations:
     ```bash
     python3 --version
     ```

2. **Pip Installation**
   - Pip is the package installer for Python. It should be installed automatically with Python. Verify pip installation by running:
     ```bash
     pip --version
     ```
     or for some installations:
     ```bash
     pip3 --version
     ```

3. **Packages Installation**
    - Run:
        ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        or
        ```
        pip3 install -r requirments.txt
        ```

## Running The Algorithm

- Command line:
    ```
    python main.py <start_index> <end_index>
    ```
- Output: 
    - length of the shortest paths of three algorithms
    - the shortest paths of three algorithms
    - file named **solutions/path-<start_index>-<end_index>.csv**
